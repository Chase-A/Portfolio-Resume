<PortfolioEntry title={'Who I am'}>
    I am a process focused designer interested in working for a company that values both good design and good systems of designing. You can see my specific interests through what I'm learning <A url={'https://chasea.notion.site/chasea/092c819a1f5443b6ad4df4a1c671786f?v=f24323e74328418d87d05faf3f91699f'}>here</A>.

<PortfolioEntry title={'What I do'}>
    I am a designer who can code. I prefer spending time designing in Figma and Figjam, focusing on user experience rather than technical performance. 
    
    I also like being able to create my own finished products using HTML, CSS, JS, and my preferred framework, Svelte, as well as being able to tune the tools I use to my workflow, like being able to create figma plugins.
