<PortfolioEntry title={'Staples Pages'}>
    As a developer at Staples, I collaborated with designers to build essential landing pages like <A url={'https://www.staples.com/deals/staples-media-network/BI3000909'}>Staples Media Network</A> and <A url={'https://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/products/220929/kcfep859/index.html'}>Auto Restock</A>. I was also in charge of designing and building pages like the <A url={'https://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/products/copy-and-print/160509/54368/index.html'}>Staples Business Center</A> landing page. You can see the improvement I made compared to the old version <A url={'https://web.archive.org/web/20220714141928/https://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/products/copy-and-print/160509/54368/index.html'}>here</A>.

<PortfolioEntry title={'Figma Plugins'}>
    While working at Staples, I identified repetitive aspects of my design process that could be automated with Figma plugins. I first developed <A url={'www.figma.com'}>Append Dimensions</A>, which appends selected nodes' dimensions to their names. This helps those on our team who deliver to marketing, as our team standard was to export designs with dimensions included in the filename.
    My second plugin, <A url={'www.figma.com'}>Frames From Text</A>, takes a string as input and parses any dimensions. These dimensions are then used to create frames in Figma automatically. This streamlined our team's workflow by allowing us to copy text from Excel or Jira, and immediately have the exact frames asked for ready to go.

    In this Figma Project, I wanted to build a prototype for a much needed UI and UX update to <A url={'https://www.earthrace.net/'}>earthrace.net</A>.
